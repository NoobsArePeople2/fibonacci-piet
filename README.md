# Fibonacci in Piet

The program 'fibonacci-piet.png' is written in the [Piet](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html) esoteric language and prints the first one hundred numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, starting with 0,1.

For a breakdown of how this works see the Piet specification (linked above) and [this tutorial](http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~diddesen/piet/index.html).

The program was coded with [PietDev](http://www.rapapaing.com/blog/?page_id=6) an online Piet editor and debugger.
